# Entropy Mouse Position Demo

An example of using a distributed, offline-first stack powered by Yjs in conjunction with Svelte components [svelt-yjs](https://github.com/relm-us/svelt-yjs). This is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of Yjs to provide low latency presence data (in this example, mouse cursour position) in a multi-user environment.
